# Crop_Prediction-IOT

## Idea 
- We've used temperature, humidity and moisture sensor data as the features for the model and this data is sent to google sheets using mobile network.
- A flask app is created which will grab this data and run random forest classifier model on it and this application is deployed into AWS server.
